# Deep learning

1. Neural networks and deep learning 
2. Improving Deep neural networks : hyper parameter tuning , regularization and optimization 
3. Structuring your machine learning projects
4. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
5. NLP: Building sequence models (RNN, LSTM) 

### Neural Network

      Neural network is made up of smaller units called neurons. It is deemed as a circuit of neurons. Artifical neural network is a set of neurons solving an AI problem. 

**Housing price prediction :** 

size (x) —> neuron —> price (y) 

$**size, bedroom --> (neuron 1 ) --> familysize -->$**   

$**zip code, postal code --> (neuron 2 ) --> walkability -->$ (neuron_final) →(0)**

$**zip code, postal code --> (neuron 3 ) --> schoolquality -->**$
